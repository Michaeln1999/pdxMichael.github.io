title: "An about page of me!"

I love being outdoors and always trying to play sports to get in a good cardio and exercise! 
The sport that I play the most would be basketball. I love to play basketball and working on my skills in basketball always trying my best every day to get better. My major is CS I really like to code things it is not bad but hard sometimes. I always like to code because I learn new things from it. My first year here has been a pretty good experience! It's hard, fun, and stressful at the same time!
